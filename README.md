## Functional Requirements

---
A user should be able to interact with the HTTP server as follows:

When a client sends a properly formatted request to the server, the server sends an appropriate response back to the client.
A client can send different HTTP requests to the server and get the appropriate response back each time.
Different clients can send messages to server and get back their proper responses.
The server should be able to handle 200, 300, and 400-level responses. Not every response code needs to be complete, but there should be a few representative response codes implemented for each level.
