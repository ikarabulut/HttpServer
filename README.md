## Requirements
- **Java**

    - Execute `brew install java` in your Command Line
  - If you do not want to use homebrew, please follow the [Java docs](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
  - After install you can run `java --version` to confirm proper installation
- **Gradle**
  - Follow these [Gradle doc instructions](https://gradle.org/install/)

# Functional Requirements

---
A user should be able to interact with the echo server as follows:

- When a client sends a message to the server, the server sends a response back to the client containing the original message.
- A client can send multiple messages to the server and get the echoed response back each time.
- Multiple clients can send messages to server and get back their proper responses.
