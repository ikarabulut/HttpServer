This project is built in [Java (OpenJDK 18)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) using [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/userguide.html).

---
## Requirements
- **Java**
  - To install Java locally you can use [Homebrew](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65601196/how-to-brew-install-java). Which will install OpenJDK and the latest stable version of java.
    - Execute `brew install java` in your Command Line
  - If you do not want to use homebrew, please follow the [Java docs](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
  - After install you can run `java --version` to confirm proper installation
- **Gradle**
  - Follow these [Gradle doc instructions](https://gradle.org/install/)
  
- **[direnv](https://direnv.net/)**
  - Used for local environment variables
  - To install using homebrew run `brew install direnv` in your terminal
  - Follow these instructions to hook direnv to your shell https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html
    - For ZSH add the following line to your .zshrc file
      - `eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"`


## Functional Requirements

---
**A user should be able to interact with the HTTP server as follows:**

- When a client sends a properly formatted request to the server, the server sends an appropriate response back to the client.
- A client can send different HTTP requests to the server and get the appropriate response back each time.
- Different clients can send messages to server and get back their proper responses.
- The server should be able to handle 200, 300, and 400-level responses. Not every response code needs to be complete, but there should be a few representative response codes implemented for each level.
